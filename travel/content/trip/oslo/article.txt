# Første Dag
Oslo (with neighbouring Sandvika-Asker) is built in a horseshoe shape on the shores of the Oslofjord and limited in most directions by hills and forests. As a result, any point within the city is relatively close to the forest.
There are two major forests bordering the city: (link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98stmarka text: Østmarka) (literally “Eastern Forest”, on the eastern perimeter of the city), and the very large (link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordmarka text: Nordmarka) (literally “Northern Forest”, stretching from the northern perimeter of the city deep into the hinterland).

Oslo’s cityscape is being redeveloped as a modern city with various access-points, an extensive metro-system with a new financial district and a cultural city. In 2008, an exhibition was held in London presenting the award-winning Oslo Opera House, the urban regeneration scheme of Oslo’s seafront, Munch/Stenersen and the new Deichman Library.

# Festival Season
A large number of festivals are held in Oslo, such as Oslo Jazz festival, a six-day Jazz festival which has been held annually in August for the past 25 years. Oslo’s biggest Rock festival is Øyafestivalen or simply “Øya”. It draws about 60,000 people to the Medieval Park east in Oslo and last for four days.
