Text: 

Staying with Emily's family, practically living with them, in their family house down there, show the intense connection they feel to this area. As a visitor to such a tiny community, I almost felt out of place - it was certainly a day or so until I felt as if I was permitted to be living in the paradise.

Put it this way, though: the entire trip was spectacular enough that I neglected my camera. I purposefully chose to leave it behind whenever we left the house, to simply take in the majesty of little Bendy.

# The Long Way 'Round

Getting back from Bendy was one of the best things I've ever done. Taking what turned out to be a rather sizeable detour (about five hours' worth), nonetheless.
