# Feet on the Ground

It had been a long haul to get here. Not to mention the amount of running we'd done. Do you have any idea how long an international terminal is?

About 5 minutes of sprinting long.

Kingsford-Smith, of course, was entierly average, and wholly unsurprising. Skipping lunch, there were significant delays in getting through customs, and now *Final Call* was reverbrating through the terminal's woeful PA system. Tracking 18 people through a bustling area, checking on each person to ensure they're still with us, and all got on the plane - it really wouldn't do to lose someone at this point.

The adrenalline pumping through me, mixed with the frantic energy of adventure kept me awake for the entire flight. I was the only person to farewell the Australian mainland, as we passed the tip of Western Australia, and cruising north-west into the Indian Ocean.

It was around the fifth hour into the flight when the cramps started. I'd been sitting for too long, not even moving and adjusting my position in the seat. With most everyone asleep, I peered into the inky night, whispering to noone in particular, "I need a jog after seven hours in this damn seat".

Our wheels touched down in Kuala Lumpar in just under eight hours from Sydney. Even in the terminal, the humidity was present, a horrid persence that we would be assulted with at every moment during our month.

Changing terminals for the domestic flight to Kota Kinabalu, we took the automated tram across the expanse between terminals. From the outside in the night, it was impossible to see the enormous letter *H* that made the shape of the building. Arriving at the domestic terminal, we set of at a leisurely pace for Gate A04, at one end of the *H*. Passing Gate A10, a chilling accouncement sounded: our flight had been diverted to Gate B11, and this was final call.

Never had there been a more frantic group of over-tired teens. We had been awake now since 7am Sydney time - it was currently, sprinting along the polished marble tiles, leaping on travelators, overbalancing as the floor became solid again, 4am. We'd been awake for 21 hours, and it was showing.

Many of us slept through our meal on the flight over to the small island of Borneo. Miffy, the vegetarian amongst us, had the worst meal: a soggy, congealed salad roll. For dessert, instead of the chocolate given to us meat-eaters, she was given an unassuming fruit salad.

Staying at the *Summer Lodge*, in the middle of Kota Kinabalau, we were all glad to arrive at our beds that night, even if it had been at the hands of a taxi driver whose foot didn't leave the accelerator the entire trip.


# First Steps

Although we slept late, today was our first full day in Borneo - and for most of us, our first day outisde of Australia. The first sensation was sound: with a weekend market outside, from early morning the loud bustle of trade, yelping and mewing of cats and the endless car horns.

Leaving our dorms to explore, we wandered from the main district down to the water's edge, and then through the street markets. The simple ofactory assult was intense: open drains outside of the city centre, spices, and just the smell of people, people everywhere.

It was in a permanent street market that we met Mickey. Pushing past a silk and scarf stall, we found him and his brother. Full of energy impossible for their size, I looked around, and asked their Mum if I could photograph the boys. Turning back, I waved at them, and it was like a drill sergant had screamed *Attention!* I became the centre of their world, chatting, taking photos. Looking curiously at the camera, I invited Mickey to take a photo, learn how it worked. He was a fast learner, though the first crack of the shutter made him jump!

That evening, we climed to the flat roof of the *Summer Lodge* where we were staying, and looked out over this incredible city, tiny though it was.

***

Our first real hike with our packs was the 2km walk across town to the bus terminal. In a bid to reduce congestion in the city centre, busses were completely banned from Kota Kinabalu, instead operating from a terminal on the outskirts of the city. By 10am, on a clear, humid day, temperatures had already reached way-too-hot. Needless to say, we weren't particularly happy by the time we arrived.

This bus would take us to the Crocker Range, where a short two-day hike, an introduction to the forests of Borneo, if you will. It was well before lunchtime when we arrived at the National Park's base camp, and shortly set off. We had quite a distance to cover before nightfall.

Directly next to the camp was the ... River, a 35 metre wide tempest. The only way across was a simple bridge - wooden planks spread over tensioned wires. The entire span could support only one person at a time. As the locals danced across, we tiptoed, acutely aware of how high our centre of gravity was with our packs on.
